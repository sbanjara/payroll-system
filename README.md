# Payroll System
  
  This is a web based implementation of a payroll system which is in progress now. It is a web based implementation of a Time-In Time-Out Attendance System (https://github.com/sbanjara/TAS-SP19) that I worked in my Software Engineering I class. This program provides **clock-in/clock-out** interface for the company, **User Login**, **view of time punches of an employee**, **interface for employee's payroll**, and **interface for employee's absenteeism**. The completed version of this program will be posted shortly.
